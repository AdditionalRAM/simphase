            <p>During the construction phase, changes can be the most expensive and may result in legal disputes due to cost and schedule overruns. Since changes during the construction process are inevitable, a new strategy called BIM has emerged. With BIM, planners and clients can detect and correct errors early, making costs and schedules more controllable than later in the construction process.</p>

            <p>Scrum is the art of doing twice the work in half the time. As traditional project management methods are not easily applicable to rapidly changing requirements and needs, this agile project management method was developed.</p>

            <p class="big">Simulation - the AI problem finder and solution provider</p>
            <p>By using simulation software, engineers and designers can model the various aspects of a system or process to test its performance under different conditions and scenarios. This allows them to compare different designs and configurations before a physical prototype is built, saving time and costs. Simulating and verifying can also help identify errors and issues before a product or plant is built, leading to higher quality and reliability</p>
            <p>Given the rapidly changing requirements and needs in the construction industry, we are looking for methods that offer fast and verified solutions. One way we have mentioned is the use of BIM and a shared data environment that allows us to quickly reach agreements. Another method is the new agile project management that helps us keep track and thoroughly consider changes. Finally, we also use simulations to support our work by utilizing artificial intelligence as a problem solver and solution provider.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">MacLeamy's graph illustrates that if changes are required during the construction phase, it is the most expensive of all, which may lead to the litigation phase.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">A new strategy is necessary to shift the design forward in time, before the construction phase begins at all. The new strategy is called BIM to achieve this goal successfully.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">We at Simphase emphasize the importance of the BIM strategy with our logo, and we do <strong>everything possible to shift the design phase forward as it is illustrated in the graph</strong>.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">One of the most significant benefits of <strong>simulation</strong> is that it enables us to analyze complex systems quickly and efficiently. By using simulation software, we can create a virtual model of a system and test it under various conditions, without the need for physical prototyping. This makes the design process <strong>faster and more cost-effective</strong>, as we can identify potential problems and optimize the system before building a physical prototype.</p>

            <img class="size-full wp-image-6803 alignleft" src="images/Semih-SENER-2-22.jpg" alt="Semih Sener Portrait" width="319" height="423">
        </div>     
        <p class="scroll-effect">Semih Sener describes himself as an MEP BIM Manager because the implementation of BIM in the Technical Building Services (TBS) is his top priority. He holds an openBIM certificate and is also certified as a Scrum Master, indicating experience in the agile project management methodology. He is an advocate for digital transformation in the construction industry and is highly interested in the use of robots, digital twins, and artificial intelligence in the sector.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">The concept of Parametric Design was originally developed by PTC and later adopted by Autodesk with Revit. PTC was already successful with their concept of digital twins and is now a leading pioneer in this field. In 2004, Semih Sener worked as a PTC consultant and became familiar with these concepts.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">Even as a teenager, he was interested in sustainability, return on investment, and technology, spending time in his father's workshop. When converting to autogas, all three aspects were crucial.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">During his studies, he focused on renewable energies and robotics. In his professional life as a consultant and TBS planner, he advocates for the use of renewable energy systems such as PV systems, heat pumps, and VRF devices. In countries with warm climates such as Turkey, he used VRF heat pump systems in all projects, which were used for both cooling and heating purposes.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">Both experiences were very challenging. He often faced resistance because many people found it difficult to imagine how the new technologies would work. Nevertheless, he remained convinced that it was worth implementing new technologies and learned to deal with many objections. This time, it is the BIM method or digital transformation, where he repeatedly feels resistance.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">He has given numerous presentations on digital transformation and developed a testing program during his master's degree to help companies assess their maturity level in terms of digital transformation.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">The BIM method represents the digital transformation in the construction industry. Similar to the assembly line and waterfall project methodology in the past, the agile project management method now plays a significant role in conjunction with AI in digitization. Therefore, it is of great importance to use the BIM method in conjunction with agile project management methods and simulations to maximize the benefits of AI.</p>
      
        <p class="scroll-effect">He is currently working to fully introduce the BIM method in the construction industry, maximize the full potential of the BIM method, and revolutionize the construction industry. He is open to new contacts who share similar interests.</p>
