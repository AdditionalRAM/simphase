        <p class="big scroll-effect">Why the application of Scrum in the construction industry makes sense</p>
    </div>
    <p class="scroll-effect"><em>"Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time"</em> is a well-known statement by Jeff Sutherland, the co-founder of Scrum, emphasizing the effectiveness of the agile method.</p>
    <p class="scroll-effect">Regular feedback loops and inspections are built into the process to ensure that the project stays on track and that changes occurring during the project can be implemented <strong>quickly and effectively</strong>.</p>
    <!-- tiny whitespace -->

    <ul class="low-padding">
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p><strong>Scrum</strong> is a framework of the agile project management method used in the production realm of the digital transformation era to enable more efficient and faster project implementation. <strong>The goal is to achieve double the work in half the time.</strong></p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p>The waterfall project management method was used in the past during mass production. Through this method, Henry Ford was able to reduce the production time of the Model T from 12 hours to 1.5 hours in 1913, which effectively means achieving twice the amount of work in half the time.</p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p>In the past, the assembly line played a significant role in reducing production time, while today, <strong>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</strong> is used as a digital planning method for construction projects to enhance collaboration and efficiency.</p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p>The methods and tools of the past are no longer sufficient to ensure fast and effective production. The waterfall approach is not as flexible as agile methods like Scrum and can lead to issues in complex projects. Therefore, it is advisable to employ BIM in project execution to ensure successful and efficient implementation.</p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p><strong>BIM (Building Information Modeling)</strong> is a method for digitally transforming the construction industry. To address the challenges of this transformation, agile project management is being utilized. Therefore, it is recommended to apply the BIM method in combination with agile project management.</p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p><strong>Scrum</strong> is indeed the most widely used agile method, with a <strong>usage rate of 85%</strong>.</p></li>
        <li class="scroll-effect"><p>Frequently, <strong>Lean management</strong> is employed during the implementation of the BIM method. Although Lean management is not explicitly part of agile project management methods, many of the principles of Lean can be applied in agile development and agile project management. Nevertheless, when choosing a project management method, we prefer Scrum.</p></li>
    </ul>    
    <p class="scroll-effect">In summary, we are currently in the fourth industrial revolution, also known as the digital transformation. It is essential to apply agile project management methods in order to produce effectively and successfully. <strong>The methods used in previous industrial revolutions are no longer effective in this context.</strong> As part of the digital transformation in the construction industry, we utilize Building Information Modeling (BIM) and adopt agile project management methods in our project execution. In this regard, we rely on the most widely used framework called Scrum.</p>

    <p class="scroll-effect"><strong>Let's Scrum!</strong></p>
    <p class="scroll-effect">Here is a schematic representation of how we implement the BIM method within the Scrum framework:</p>

    <p class="scroll-effect">BEPs and EIRs in the BIM Method: BIM encompasses various documents such as BIM Execution Plans (BEPs) and Employer's Information Requirements (EIRs), which are essential for the successful implementation of construction projects. These documents can be integrated into the agile project management method of Scrum to further optimize the planning and execution of construction projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p class="scroll-effect">As can be seen from the graphic, the construction industry ranks among the least digitized sectors according to the McKinsey Global Institute Industry Digitization Index.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">Each industrial revolution has brought significant increases in efficiency and acceleration to the respective industry. Any manufacturer who wants to keep up must be able to meet the requirements of the specific industrial revolution. Can you imagine, for example, an automobile manufacturer who did not adopt mass production? We are not talking about niche productions here.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">On the other hand, it is known that the construction industry has not yet fully embraced digitalization. Therefore, in order to drive digital transformation in the construction industry, it is essential to adopt Building Information Modeling (BIM).</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">Digital transformation in the construction industry is necessary to work more efficiently and productively. By implementing digital technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), planning and construction processes can be optimized, errors can be avoided, and communication between different trades can be improved. This ultimately leads to higher quality buildings, faster completion times, and cost reduction.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">In our blog, we will, therefore, report on new developments that may not seem relevant or even possible for the construction industry at first glance.</p>

            <p class="scroll-effect">Finally, we would like to highlight how Henry Ford demonstrated during his time in the Industrial Revolution that production could be greatly accelerated. He managed to produce 1,000 cars per day, while his competitors were producing around 10-12 cars per day.</p>

        <p class="scroll-effect big">How Henry Ford accelerated the production in 1914</p>
    </div>

    <p class="scroll-effect">Henry Ford is considered one of the pioneers of the automobile industry and has significantly shaped it. In 1914, he initiated a revolution in mass production that allowed him to reduce the purchase price of the Ford Model T from $850 to $300. How did he accomplish this?</p>

    <p class="scroll-effect">Firstly, he improved the working conditions for his workers and reduced the workday from 12 hours to 8 hours per day. At the same time, he increased the wage from $2.50 per hour to $5 per hour. This allowed him to hire and retain more skilled employees, which had a positive impact on productivity.</p>

    <p class="scroll-effect">Furthermore, Henry Ford introduced the concept of the assembly line. By dividing the work into small, standardized steps, the production time for each automobile was reduced from 12 hours to 1.5 hours. This made it possible to produce 1,000 automobiles daily, totaling 308,162 vehicles in 1914. Meanwhile, his competitors had an average production rate of approximately 10-12 cars per day.</p>

    <p class="scroll-effect">Henry Ford's success in the automotive industry demonstrates the importance of continually questioning and optimizing production methods. The introduction of new technologies and work methods can have a significant impact on the efficiency and success of a company.</p>
